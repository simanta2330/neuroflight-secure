A vehicle that flies without a human is called an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). In a digital UAV system there can be many security vulnerabilities. First we have to know what equipment is used in an UAV system.
These are…

-CPU & RAM
-Some type of communication system (either through Wi-Fi or other radio frequency) 
-A camera for photography and video 
-Some sort of data storage for files and an operating system
-Some types of sensors, the most common of which is GPS 
-A battery
-Aeronautical hardware for flight 
-A controller for manual flight operations

Several types of cyber attack can happen in this system….
* De-authentication Attack: This is an attack which is related to the Wifi network. It can happen through a mobile device or an app system. In this attack hacker broke the connection between the vehicle and controller as a result the drone lost its control and fell down. An attacker uses the vehicle's MAC address and sends a hang-up packet that disconnects the connection.
How can we defend this vulnerability: Drone can back to the  take-off point safely, can ground themself on the spot safely or use firewall
* GPS Spoofing: In this attack system attackers create a strong GPS signal that prevents the original GPS signal then the drone response to that hacker’s GPS. How can we defend this attack:
We can use a pre-trained ai model to predict normal flight paths.
Use multi GNSS & Multi frequency receivers (AI can choose reliable signals)
* GPS Jamming: It’s a well known attack for military war since many years. As a satellite GPS signal is literally weak so that it can easily happen. If an attacker able to create a strong signal for drone than satellite signal then the drone take that strong signal
Prevention is the same as with GPS spoofing.

* Man-in-the-Middle Attack: It’s also a well known attack for drone security. In this attack system an attack can stay between two systems. They are able to take access to these two systems at a time. Attacker changes the communication location. How to prevent:
Communication Encryption
Mutual Authentication
Secure protocols only

* Session Hijacking: It’s an attack which combines De-authentication and MITM attacks. In this system an attacker takes the access to both vehicles at the same time. How to prevent:    
Use secure session tokens
Encrypt All Communications (TLS/SSL/VPN)
Use Session Timeouts and Rotation     
                                                   
* Attacking Geofences: Geofencing technology uses GPS, GNSS,Wifi,Bluetooth & IP Address. A standard area that is fixed for a drone to fly. The vehicle will not cross that boundary. An attacker can change the area as a result the drone can’t understand their area. This system uses GPS Spoofing, MITM, Sensor Manipulation (IMU,Altimeter)
